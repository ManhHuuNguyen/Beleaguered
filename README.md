A first person shooter/ capture the flag game made in Unity. 

This is a small game I made over the weekend. The game's goal is to capture the enemy's flag and bring it back to your base before enemies could find your flag or kill you.

The game has only one level, but it has AIs with multiple personalities and strategies that are actually challenging so it could be a lot of fun!

You can download the build executable to try out. The in-depth rule of the game, all the game features as well as a bird-eye view into how the AIs think are explained clearly on the video. 
Although the game looks a bit laggy on the video, in reality it runs very smoothly. Any lag is actually incurred by the video capture software.
